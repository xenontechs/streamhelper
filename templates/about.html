<h1>{% block title %} About {% endblock %}</h1>
<p>this is a tool to automate things in OBS, to be called from within OBS, that can interface with things outside of OBS. it is based on python, uses flask to present you with a Browser Dock (OBS) and calls preprogrammed changes via OBS Websocket. Further triggers can be configured in use with streamer.bot and because it's fun, it solves all other annoying problems as well</p>
<p>if you can read this then you found a work-in-progress app. good luck with the config file</p>
